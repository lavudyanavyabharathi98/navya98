      <h1>1. Taj Mahal </h1>
<p>Agra is an unmissable stop on your tour of India. There are many places of interest to a visitor in Agra, the most famous of course being the iconic and very beautiful Taj Mahal. 
<br>

A UNESCO World Heritage site and an eternal symbol of love (it was built by an emperor in memory of his third wife). The white-domed structure boasts delicately detailed interiors, tranquil gardens and a collection of other impressive buildings.<br>

        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
       
    The Agra Fort is the sister monument of the Taj Mahal and also holds UNESCO heritage site status. The striking fort dates from the year 1000 but was later remodelled in the 1500s to be used as a palace. Thirteen kilometres from the Agra Fort you will find Akbar’s Tomb, a stunning red-ochre sandstone tomb and another architectural masterpiece.
          </div>
       
</p>
 <p>
  <h1> 2. Goa </h1>
  </html>The famously beautiful beach and party resort.
  The famous idyllic party place should not be missed and it’s still one of the most popular places to visit in India as well as the most beautiful. If you decide to take a trip, I recommend not leaving the island’s coastal areas. Goa is the smallest state in India and has the most beautiful beaches by far – when you’re here you’ll want to make the most of them.<br>
   <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">ReadMore</button></button>
        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
       
Many refer to Goa as a tropical paradise and when you’re here enjoying the warm temperatures, clear turquoise water, and palm trees you’ll also probably agree. If you time your visit around the Goa Carnival held every February you’ll be treated to three days and nights of music, lights, dancers, and awesome food.

This is when the legendary King Momo takes over the state and the island becomes party central. Originally celebrated in the 1800s by locals only, now both tourists and locals come here to have a good time.</p>
<br>
<br>
</div>
<p>
  <h1> 3. Mumbai </h1> 
  The bustling and vibrant city which is one of the most famous cities to visit in India.<br>

This place has a kind of beauty all of its own. Formally known as Bombay, Mumbai is the most populated city in India. Noisy, frantic, and polluted, Mumbai is a melting pot of different cultures, religions, and wealth extremes. Even though the city is developing at a fast rate, unfortunately, you’ll still see many scenes of poverty.<br>
   <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">ReadMore</button></button>
        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
       
The city is also the birthplace of Indian cinema and there are many theatres to watch movies from all over the world (including the world’s largest IMAX dome theatre).

A visually impressive city Mumbai has a large metropolitan area comparable to the size of New York’s skyline and a fine but eclectic mix of colonial buildings, stylish bars, colourful bazaars, and shiny new malls. Finding something to do here would not be a problem.</p></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  
  <h1> 4. Golden Temple </h1>
  In Amritsar, Punjab - a beautiful and spiritual place and the main attraction in the city of Amritsar.

<br>

Amritsar is a city close to India’s border with Pakistan that is the beating heart of Punjab as well as a principal place of worship for Sikhs. The Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) is considered the holiest shrine in Sikhism and draws people from all over the world to marvel and worship at it. Many tourists return to the temple after darkness falls to listen to the sounds of prayer emanating from it.
<br>    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">ReadMore</button></button>
        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
       
Everyone that visits the temple can sit down for a free meal, known as langar, which is served to 50,000 people by hundreds of volunteers every day. The food is made in vats due to the scale of it, and each plate is washed 5 times afterwards. In the early evening, don’t miss the Wagah-Attari border ceremony.

This is an elaborate ceremony performed by the Indian and Pakistani military to show comradeship between the nations.
</p></div>
  <br><br>
  
  <h1>
5. Kodaikanal </h1>
One of the most famous honeymoon destinations in India.<br>

In the Ghat mountains lies this beautiful and atmospheric town, which translated means “the gift of the forest.” Easily one of the most beautiful places to visit in India, Kodaikanal has many places of interest for travelers and tourists. One of which is the Kodaikanal lake which is a star-shaped man-made lake.<br>
   <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">ReadMore</button></button>
        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
       
Here you can rent bicycles to ride around the shore. Just east of the lake is a 20-acre botanical garden, from here you can reach Coaker’s Walk, a 1-kilometre long pedestrian path that follows along the south of Kodai. Expect wooded slopes, rocky scenery, and beautiful waterfalls.
<br><br>
</p></div>
 
  <h1>
   6. Manali
  </h1>
One of the most popular hill stations in Himachal, Manali offers the most magnificent views of the Pir Panjal and the Dhauladhar ranges covered with snow for most parts of the year. <br>
With the Covid-19 pandemic going on, Manali has evolved to be a place loved by young people looking for longer stays for workation. With ambient cafes, good wifi availability, small eateries and convenient shops, Old Manali is among the favorite neighbourhood for such people. There are many homestays and hostels offering dorm beds for cheap for longer durations. 
<br>    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">ReadMore</button></button>
        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
       
Manali has many trekking options around it, making it a great base for exploring this side of Himalayas. River Beas provides great rafting options in the nearby town of Kullu. Adjoining Parvati river, lies the Parvati Valley with  Kasol, Manikaran, Tosh and small villages attracting travellers for longer stays. Atal Tunnel now allows travellers to reach Sissu within a few hours making Spiti way more accessible. 
<br>
It snows the most in the months of January & February followed by December and March. If you're very lucky, you might find some snow in April. 
<br>
Tourists flock to Rohtang Pass & Solang valley for various adventure activities including skiing, paragliding, horse-riding & zorbing. Rohtang Pass is almost always covered with snow and can often get overcrowded and see traffic jams.
  
</p><br><br></div>
<p>
  <h1>7. Ooty</h1>
  
 Nestled amidst Nilgiri hills, Ooty, also known as Udagamandalam, is a hill station in Tamil Nadu which serves as a top-rated tourist destination. Once regarded as the summer headquarters of the East India Company, the Queen of the hills is a picturesque getaway.
 <br>    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">ReadMore</button></button>
        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
       

Dotted with tea gardens, serene waterfalls, winding country lanes, and charming colonial architecture, Ooty is the perfect respite everyone. Popular among couples and honeymooners, Ooty allures its visitors with the panoramic views of the Nilgiri mountains.
<br>
The Nilgiri mountain railway is the steepest track in all of Asia. Remember the hit song 'Chaiyya Chaiyya' where Shahrukh Khan and Malaika Arora matching steps on top of a train? Remember the breathtaking locales as the train chugged its way across lush greenery? Yes, that was the Nilgiri Mountain Railways, and the Nilgiri Mountains all along.<br><br>
</p></div>
<p>
  <h1>
    8. Hyderabad </h1>
    
A city of contrasts, Hyderabad exudes an old-world charm of its own with the Old City (Charminar side), Hitech City (Cyberabad) and the other areas lying between the old and the new. The capital and the largest city of Telanaga, Hyderabad is home to stately mosques and noisy bazaars lined parallelly alongside swanky new office buildings and malls, and it is these very contrasts – these glimpses into the city’s rich past with inherent promises of an even better future –that make Hyderabad a city worth visiting. Maybe even more than once.
 <br>    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">ReadMore</button></button>
        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
       
The city of pearls and biryani, Hyderabad is home to one of the most iconic landmarks - the Charminar. Translating to 'four minarets', the grand edifice is built entirely out of limestone and granite, with four minarets on four sides, each of them facing a different street. The Charminar stands in a labyrinth of lanes crammed with shops, markets, stalls and shoppers - one of the best places to shop for the authentic pearls and relish the tasty biryanis, skewer kebabs and haleem (the smorgasbord of food that Hyderabad is known for).  
<br>

The other side of Hyderabad - HiTech City or Cyberabad - is a stark contrast to the Old City. The area teems with grand malls, pulsating clubs, sleek restaurants and hi-rise buildings of the every-growing multinationals. Between the old and new lie the popular city areas of Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills flanked on the northeast by Secunderabad. Hyderabad and Secunderabad together are still referred to as the "twin cities", though they are practically one now. 

Hyderabad pulsates with a spectacular mix of people and traditions. Make a journey through this mind-stirring metropolis and be ready to be amazed, frustrated, confounded and thrilled, all at once!</p><br><br></div>
<p>
  <h1>9. Ajanta and Ellora Caves</h1>
Ajanta and Ellora caves, considered to be one of the finest examples of ancient rock-cut caves, are located near Aurangabad in Maharashtra, India. Ajanta and Ellora caves complex is adorned with beautiful sculptures, paintings, and frescoes and include Buddhist monasteries, Hindu and Jain temples. The Ajanta caves are 29 in number and were built between the 2nd century BC and 6th century AD, whereas the Ellora Caves are more spread out and 34 in number and dates to the period between 6th and 11th Century AD.
<br>    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">ReadMore</button></button>
        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
       
Ajanta and Ellora caves are designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites and are quite popular among travelers worldwide. Ajanta Caves, located around 99km north of Aurangabad, are mostly Buddhist sites and were used as a retreat by Buddhist Monks. Ellora is just 15 km west of Aurangabad and has a better mix of Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist sites. These hand-carved caves were built and sponsored by the Indian rulers of those periods and almost buried by thick forests. One of the most famous places in the entire Ajanta and Ellora Caves is the Kailash Temple, which is also the single most massive monolithic structure globally. These rock-cut caves containing carvings are some of the best examples of ancient Indian architecture and sculpture.</p><br><br></div>
<p>
  <h1>10. Haridwar</h1>
 
Haridwar, considered to be among the seven holiest cities in India, is an ancient city located on the banks of River Ganga in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. Dotted with temples, ashrams and narrow lanes across the city, Haridwar is a famous Hindu temple town where millions of devotees come to take a dip in the holy Ganges. It's believed that taking a dip in the holy Har Ki Pauri relieves you of all your sins.
<br>    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">ReadMore</button></button>
        <div id="demo" class="collapse">
       
Every evening, Haridwar is witness to a set of rituals for the famous Ganga Aarti at the Ghats (River Banks) where thousands of devotees come together to pray to the river. Once in every twelve years, Haridwar is host to the mega-gathering during the world famous Kumbh Mela which sees millions of visitors from all over the country. Along with Prayagraj, Nashik and Ujjain, Haridwar is one of the only four cities in India which can host the Kumbh Mela.

Haridwar also acts as the base destination for some of the other tourist towns of Rishikesh and Devprayag as Hardwar is well connected by trains and roads. Apart from the religious angle, Haridwar is also now developing as a multifaceted cultural and spiritual centre. It's also known for its food and some of the must-try dishes include kachoris at Kashyap Kachoriwala and the aloo puri at Mohanji Puriwale. </p><br><br>
